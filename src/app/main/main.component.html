        To keep our application modular, we separate out each portion of our HTML in sections, these sections become their own set of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, essentially, each part of our application can be its own component. This brings more modularity and
        ability to reuse our code as needed. For example, we may make a component called 'NoteComponent' which displays a note, in its own styled format. Anytime we need a note to appear in that same format, we can simply use that Component to load that
        Note, we simply need to choose what data we want to pass the NoteComponent so when we use it, it will have the desired data. (More on this during the @Input section) Each Component consists of the 3 separate files (4 if you include the spec file
        for testing) and usually included in a folder named after the component's name used in creation. The initial component is the AppComponent (in the app folder), a new component called Task would be in the TaskComponent (in a new folder called task,
        generated by the CLI for us, assuming we used the cli in the following approach ng generate component task).
